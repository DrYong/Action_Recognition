DESCRIPTION

This package contains the Matlab+C implementation of a model for action
recognition. Taking a clip as input, the model computes a C2 vector for 
each frame, SVMHMM is traied to classify each frame and the label for a
clip is determined as the majority of predicted labels for all the frames.

This system models the organization of human visual pathway with four
feedforward hierachical stages, each specifically models the neuronal
properties of V1 and MT, two cortical areas which have been known to
process motion informaion by being selective to spatial frequency, temporal
frequency, direction and speed of moving stimuli.

___________________________________________________________________________
Tested Configuration
1 Matlab 2008b or higher
2 CUDA 3.2
3 NVIDIA GPU that supports the CUDA API
4 Opencv 2.2 or higher

Installation of cns
1 See http://cbcl.mit.edu/jmutch/cns/doc/install.html for the instructions
2 open third_party/cns/scripts/linux/setup
  edit the line  
  set CUDA_LINK_LIB = /usr/local/cuda/lib/libcudart.so
  to point to your cuda library
3 run setup_cns.m

Installation of SVMHMM
1 The binaries for svmhmm was downloaded from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/svm_light/svm_hmm.html
  If it doesn't work, download the source code and coompile it.


Compilation of mex files 
1 Edit the variable 'opencv_path' in compile.m and run compile

___________________________________________________________________________
USING THE SOFTWARE

1 After the installation is complete, run demo.m
2 Using 'setting_WIS', the model performs 100% on the WIS dataset
3 To train/test on HMDB, please download the dataset from http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resources/HMDB/index.htm
  and use 'setting_HMDB'
4 If you want to test on other datasets X, create your own 'setting_X' and optimize parameters such as scale, speed, patchsize, etc.
